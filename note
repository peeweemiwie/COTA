1. Display the following array of objects in a table, with column headers "Year" and "Movie".

2. Include a simple form with two text inputs and a submit button that allows the user to add a new year and movie to the list.

3. Include buttons for sorting by year (oldest to newest), sorting by movie (A - Z) and sorting randomly.

4. While the CSS is not important for this exercise, do include some basic styling as you see fit.

5. You can use whatever technology you'd like (vanilla JS, JQuery, AngularJS, etc.).
